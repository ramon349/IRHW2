project layout 
/HW2/MQ2007 
  - should contain all unzipped files. Should add featureNames.txt 
/HW2/MQ2008 
    - same as above 
/HW2 
  - Has thee MQ oflders 
  - all the .py and sh files  
  - the RankLib.jar 
  - Eval-Score-4.0 pl 
  - should also have RefTable.txt and sitemap.txt 


todo for similarity features: 
1. Download the MQ2008-semi and MQ2007-semi data
2. Extract only the Large_NULL.TXT files.
  2.a in hw folder make a folder called utils 
  2.a rename the large_null files to MQ2008_large_null.txt and MQ2007_large_null.txt and put then in utils
3. download the 2007 and 2008 simi files. alos move them to the utils folder 
  3.a name the files 2007_large_simi respectively 
3. run bash ./processing_scripts/getQuery2Doc.sh 
  3a. This generates  MQ2008_list and MQ2007_list.txt  which is the rankigns of documents and query pairs 
  3b. This is needed by get_simi.py to calculate the actual features 
  3c. This script will also extract the necessary similarity features by calling get_simi.py 
4. run bash ./processing_scripts/generate_dataset.sh 
 4.a this will generate the augmented datasets now called 2007_augData and 2008_augData
